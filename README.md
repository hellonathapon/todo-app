## Motivation

I start this project dead simple todo application but COVID-19 quarantine gives me a lot of free time so i come with the idea why not make it a little bit better by making the _Todo House_, a community where people can rest their todos here and let people will notify you when it react due date. they will earn reputation on this wonderful community. :)
